Her <b>Roman Equivalent</b> is most likley <b>Diana</b>. Her history is seen as the daughter of Zeus and Leto, so this makes here the twin sister of Apollo. Artemis is widley regarded as the Goddess of <b>the Hunt, Forests and Hills, the Moon, and the Goddess of Archery.</b> Her childhood was not recorded in any form. The Illiad claims that she was thrashed by Hera, so she climbed weeping into Zeus's lap. Artemis was seen a lot thorughout Greek Culture. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Didrachme_de_Ionie.jpg/1920px-Didrachme_de_Ionie.jpg" style="float:right" alt="Given that it was a kids movie, it still is saddening but it wasn't truly good" width="350" height="175"> On the right, you can see a coin that was inscribed with her likeness.
                        <br> In addition to having coins made in her likness, Artemis was also widley worshipped and celebrated. The <b>Artemis Temple</b> was built for this purpose. In additon to this, there was also the Artemis Sanctuary. These two things were built to worship her. There were also many festivals that were in her dedication. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Bust_of_the_goddess_of_Issa%2C_Vis_Museum%2C_Croatia.JPG/800px-Bust_of_the_goddess_of_Issa%2C_Vis_Museum%2C_Croatia.JPG" alt="I don't mean to sound hearless, it was a sad and somber movie, but it just didn't play too well with me. It could have been much better, but in the end, I guess it was good for what it was" height="267" width="200" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:15px;"> In the end, Artemis was one of the most influential Greek Gods. She was remembered as the Goddess of the Hunt, and her countless temples, sanctuaries, and events and festivals will remember her for this.
